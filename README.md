# Emergency Contacts App

This app is about the ease of finding national emergency contacts and personal emergency contacts in instance

## Getting Started

### Why the emergency contacts app:
- A lot of people in the world can't remember the emergency contacts at the time of need, due to shock of some events occured in front of them their minds become blank like the new piece of paper.
- Sometimes a miserable moment happened with the owner of the device so people can't find their contacts easily. 

Due to such and more similar reasons this app we think is a basic neccessity for everyone. They have national emergency contacts + their very own personal relatives or friends contacts in their hands.
